# TEXT--CLASSIFICATION--PROJECT
 A machine learning project that classifies text messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using Naive Bayes and TF-IDF vectorization. Built with Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK.
Objective
Building a ML model that classifies text as spam or ham.

Dataset
SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle.

Steps:
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes
4. Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Tech Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK

How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
python evaluate.py
